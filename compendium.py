### Chapter1. The way of the program
#The first program
print("Hello World")        #Hello World
43+2                        #47
84/2                        #42.0
6^2                         #4     (XOR: 00000110 ^ 00000010 = 00000100)

#Values and types
type(2)                     #<class 'int'>
type(42.0)                  #<class 'float'>
type('text')                #<class 'str'>

### Chapter2. Variables, expressions and statements
#Keywords in Python

#PEMDAS
#Parentheses have highest precedence
#Exponentiation: 2**3
#Multiplication & Division have higher precedence than Addition & Subtraction

#Strings
"Hello" + " World"          #Hello World
"Spam" * 3                  #SpamSpamSpam

#Comments
#Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code.
#It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out what the code does;
#it is more useful to explain why.
